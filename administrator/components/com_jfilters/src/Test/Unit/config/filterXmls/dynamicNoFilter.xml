Configuration for the generation of the dynamic filters.
The file defines if a filter will be generated from a dynamic type (e.g. fields) and it's configuration.
Filters not mentioned here, but will be encountered in the runtime (e.g. fields: checkboxes, radio), will be generated and get the default properties.

Additionally this is the optimal place to add configuration for 3rd party field plugins.

<filters>
    <!-- configName : The filter name property as appeared in the filters.xml -->
    <Nofilter configName="fields">
        <!-- The name as appeared in the filter.definition.type property of the filters.xml -->
        <name>calendar</name>

        <!-- If false, filter will not be generated for that type -->
        <generateFilter>true</generateFilter>

        <!--
        Set the allowed display types for that filter.
        A display is a layout file name (can be found in the module's tmpl or in the module's template overrides).
        If missed, the default displays will be used.
